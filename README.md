## Overview

This application helps investment research firms and financial analysts quickly analyze earnings call transcripts. It automatically generates concise summaries, classifies overall sentiment, and extracts key financial insights including revenue trends, growth signals, risk warnings, and forward guidance.

The application runs entirely locally, ensuring data privacy and eliminating API costs. It uses Ollama to host the Mistral model, FastAPI for the backend API, and Streamlit for the user interface.

---

- **Privacy-Focused** — All processing happens locally, no data is sent to external servers
- **No API Costs** — Free to use with no usage limits

---

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Mistral** | Large Language Model for financial text analysis |
| **Ollama** | Local LLM hosting and inference |
| **FastAPI** | Backend API framework |
| **Streamlit** | Frontend user interface |
| **Requests** | HTTP client for API communication |
| **Uvicorn** | ASGI server for FastAPI |

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Python** | Version 3.8 or higher |
| **Ollama** | Installed and running |
| **Mistral Model** | Downloaded via Ollama |
| **RAM** | 8GB+ recommended |
| **Storage** | 5GB+ free space for model |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esha-Mirza/School_Of_AI_Internship.git
cd School_Of_AI_Internship/"Project-9 Earnings Call Summarizer"
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Pull Mistral Model via Ollama

```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

This downloads the Mistral model (~4.1 GB). Alternatively, you can use a smaller model:

```bash
ollama pull phi3        # 2.2 GB, faster inference
ollama pull gemma:2b    # 1.4 GB, lightest option
```

## Sample Data

The project includes a sample transcript in `data/tesla_q4_2024.txt`:

```text

## Configuration

### Changing the Model

To use a different model, modify `backend/main.py`:

```python
MODEL = "phi3"        # Change from "mistral" to your preferred model
```

### Changing the Port

**Backend Port** (default: 8000):

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Frontend Port** (default: 8501):

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.port 8502
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Model not found | Run `ollama pull mistral` to download the model |
| Connection refused | Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) |
| Port already in use | Use `--port` flag to specify a different port |
| Module not found | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Slow inference | Switch to a smaller model like `phi3` or `gemma:2b` |

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add multi-quarter trend comparison (QoQ / YoY insight tracking)
- [ ] Add speaker-level breakdown (separate CEO vs CFO vs analyst sentiment)
- [ ] Add PDF transcript upload support instead of pasted text only
